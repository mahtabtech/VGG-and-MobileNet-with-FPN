# VGG and MobileNet with FPN
## Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) with Different Models

### 1. FPN with ResNet-50

**Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs)** are used to combine feature maps from different layers of a neural network to improve object detection across multiple scales. In this example, we create an FPN using a pre-trained **ResNet-50** model. 

- **Loading** a pre-trained ResNet-50 model.
- **Extracting** feature maps from three different stages: early, middle, and late stages.
- **Building** an FPN to merge these feature maps using upsampling and merging operations.
- **Visualizing** the feature maps to observe the effectiveness of the FPN.

### 2. FPN with VGG-16

**VGG-16** is another popular convolutional neural network architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks. We can also build an **FPN** using VGG-16 to enhance multi-scale feature representation.

- **Loading** a pre-trained VGG-16 model.
- **Extracting** feature maps from three stages: the shallow convolutional layers, the middle layers, and the deeper layers.
- **Building** an FPN by merging these feature maps using 1x1 convolutions and upsampling operations to achieve uniform channel dimensions.
- **Visualizing** the output to ensure the network can effectively utilize features at different scales.

### 3. FPN with MobileNetV2

**MobileNetV2** is a lightweight, efficient convolutional neural network designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. It uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. We can create an **FPN** using MobileNetV2 to balance performance with speed.

- **Loading** a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.
- **Extracting** feature maps from different stages: early layers (which capture fine details), middle layers (which capture more complex patterns), and deeper layers (which capture high-level semantic features).
- **Building** an FPN that combines these feature maps, leveraging MobileNetV2’s efficient architecture to achieve good multi-scale detection performance with minimal computational overhead.
- **Visualizing** the results to confirm the FPN improves the network's ability to detect objects of various sizes.

## Purpose of This Code

The code in this repository demonstrates how to construct **Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs)** using different backbone models—**ResNet-50, VGG-16, and MobileNetV2**—to enhance their performance in multi-scale object detection tasks. Each model shows the process of:

- Loading the pre-trained model.
- Extracting feature maps from various stages.
- Building an FPN to merge these feature maps.
- Visualizing the results to understand how FPNs improve the model’s multi-scale feature extraction capabilities.

By experimenting with different backbones, you can see how FPNs can be adapted to various network architectures to achieve better object detection performance across different scales.
